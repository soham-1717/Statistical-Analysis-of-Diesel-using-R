# Diesel Data Analysis Project

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of diesel data over three months, focusing on density and temperature parameters. The specific objectives are:

1. **Study Relationship:** Explore the correlation between density and temperature of diesel.
2. **Estimate Trend:** Analyze the trend in the dependence of density on temperature.
3. **Temporal Trends:** Estimate the trends of density and temperature over three months (Dec-2020, Jan-2021, Feb-2021).
4. **Predict Future Behavior:** Develop predictions for the future behavior of density and temperature variables.
5. **Quality Comparison:** Assess whether the density of diesel from two tanks, A and B, is equal each month, indicating consistent quality.
6. **Quality Control:** Verify if diesel densities are within control from both an average and variation perspective, meeting specified quality criteria.
7. **Specification Limits:** Evaluate whether diesel densities meet specified limits, conducting process capability analysis.

## Introduction

Diesel fuel testing is a critical aspect of proactive maintenance to prevent engine failure, contamination, and fuel-related issues. This project delves into the analysis of diesel data using various statistical tools, including correlation and regression analysis, normality tests, f-tests, t-tests, control charts, and process capability analysis. By understanding the relationships and trends within the data, the project aims to draw conclusions regarding the quality of diesel fuel, addressing issues such as injector damage, water and sediment contamination, combustion efficiency, seasonal impact, corrosion, and filter blockages.

## Tools Used
